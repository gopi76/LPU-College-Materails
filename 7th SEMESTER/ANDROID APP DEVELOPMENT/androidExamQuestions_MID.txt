Sure, I'll answer each question one by one:

Which of the following is correct to add the layout from the resource layout to your custom file adapter?

To add the layout from a resource layout to your custom file adapter, you typically use the LayoutInflater as follows:

java
Copy code
LayoutInflater inflater = LayoutInflater.from(context);
View view = inflater.inflate(R.layout.your_layout_file, parent, false);
Which of the following is used with the view holder?

The ViewHolder pattern is used with RecyclerView to improve performance by caching references to views within the list item layout. So, the correct answer is "RecyclerView."

Method used to return the size of the list using RecyclerView?

To return the size of the list in a RecyclerView, you typically implement the getItemCount() method in your RecyclerView adapter. It might look like this:

java
Copy code
@Override
public int getItemCount() {
    return dataList.size();
}
Methods belong to RecyclerView.ViewHolder?

The RecyclerView.ViewHolder class doesn't have a lot of methods; it mainly holds references to the views within the list item layout. However, the two most commonly overridden methods are onCreateViewHolder() and onBindViewHolder(), which are not directly part of RecyclerView.ViewHolder but are used in conjunction with it.

Methods of a custom ListView?

The methods of a custom ListView would depend on your specific implementation. However, some common methods you might use when working with a custom ListView include setting an adapter (setAdapter()), handling item click events, and updating the data set.

What forces us to use the ViewHolder pattern?

The ViewHolder pattern is used in Android RecyclerViews to improve performance by caching references to views within list item layouts. It is not a requirement but is recommended for better performance when dealing with large or complex lists. It helps reduce the overhead of repeatedly calling findViewById() for each item in the list.

If you have a long list, then which custom view will give you efficient results?

In the context of Android, when dealing with long lists, RecyclerView with the ViewHolder pattern is more efficient than ListView. RecyclerView's ability to recycle and reuse views makes it a better choice for long lists.

What is the property of onCreateViewHolder() in a RecyclerView adapter?

The onCreateViewHolder() method in a RecyclerView adapter is responsible for inflating the item view layout and creating a new ViewHolder instance. Its main property is to create a new ViewHolder object and associate it with the layout resource of the list item.

Property of onBindViewHolder() in a RecyclerView adapter?

The onBindViewHolder() method in a RecyclerView adapter is responsible for populating the views within the ViewHolder with data from your data source. It's called each time a new item is about to be displayed in the RecyclerView. Its property is to bind the data to the views within the ViewHolder, making it ready for display.

If you have any more specific questions or need further clarification on any of these points, please feel free to ask.
